    <h2> R&D </h2>
    <p>1. Why git is not showing git commit command while adding a file and it is showing command for unstage ?<br>
        Git is not showing git commit command while adding a file and it is showing command for unstage because files are already staged and ready for a commit.
        </p><p>
        2. What is the difference before first push and after first push ? <br>
        Before first push there is no link between local and remote repository but after first push there will be link between local and remote repository.
        </p> <p>
        3. How the title tag is fetched to head and h1 is fetched to body when rendering a HTML file which has no structure ?<br>
        When rendering an HTML file with no structure, the browser automatically places the title tag into the head and the h1 tag into the body based on HTML parsing rules and defaults.
        </p> <p>
        4. What is the difference between href and src and why it is used in img and anchor tag ?<br>
        Href is used with anchor tag as it is used to redirect to external link while src tag is used with img as it is used to embed a content inside the webpage.
        </p> <p>
        5. Why there is three dots in if...else and do...while ?<br>
        The three dots (...) in if...else and do...while in documentation or examples are placeholders used to indicate omitted code or logic. They imply that additional statements or code blocks should be added in those places.
        </p> <p>
        6. What is the difference between spread and rest operator ?<br>
        The spread operator (...) expands an array or object, while the rest operator (...) collects multiple elements into an array or parameters and used as function parameter.
        </p><p>
        7. In for in loop while traversing through an object why the output is undefined when accessing using dot operator ?<br>
        The output is undefined because obj.key is looking for a property literally named "key" in the object, instead of dynamically accessing the property using the value of the key variable.
        </p>
        <p>
            8. Why Components should start with Capital letter? <br>
            In React, component names should start with a capital letter because JSX distinguishes between custom components and native HTML tags based on the capitalization; lowercase names are treated as HTML tags, whereas uppercase names are recognized as user-defined components, ensuring they are correctly interpreted by the JSX compiler.
        </p>
        <p>
            9.While exporting a component why default keyword is mandatory?
            The default keyword is used when exporting a component in React to specify that this is the main component or module being exported from the file, making it simpler to import without needing to know the exact name of the component. Without default, each import would require curly braces and a precise name match, whereas default allows for a single straightforward import syntax, streamlining the process and reducing potential errors.

            10.WHAT is linting error?
            A linting error is a code issue identified by a linter tool that flags deviations from coding standards, style guidelines, or best practices. It helps improve code quality, readability, and prevents potential bugs

            11.What is use of StrictMode in main.jsx
            React's StrictMode is used to highlight potential problems in an application by enabling additional checks and warnings for its child components during development.
            It helps developers write better, more resilient code by detecting unsafe lifecycle methods, legacy API usage, and unexpected side effects

            12. What is the Revenue of WhatsApp?
            Though WhatsApp's financial statements aren't public (Meta doesn't break down its revenue by company), estimates put annual revenues at about $1.3 billion as of late 2024. That's less than 1% of Meta's yearly revenues. In the past decade, WhatsApp has barely made much in the way of gains to offset its 2014 purchase price.
