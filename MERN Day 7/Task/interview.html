        <h3>what is Linting Error?</h3>
        <p> A linting error occurs when a code analysis tool (called a linter) detects issues in your code that do not adhere to predefined coding standards, 
            style guidelines, or best practices. These errors do not typically prevent the code from running, but they highlight areas that could lead to bugs, 
            reduce readability, or violate conventions.</p>
